🌿 Indigenous 3D Digital Art Gallery
Preserve Today for Tomorrow

An interactive 3D digital museum designed to safeguard Indigenous art while promoting cultural literacy for modern audiences.

📌 Overview

This project was built in response to the prompt:
“Preserve today for tomorrow: why archives matter.”

Indigenous art carries centuries of cultural knowledge, storytelling, and identity. However, much of this heritage remains physically inaccessible or insufficiently contextualized for broader audiences. Our goal was to create a platform that not only preserves Indigenous artworks digitally but also encourages meaningful engagement and understanding.

Rather than building a static archive, we developed an immersive 3D virtual gallery where visitors can explore artworks, learn their cultural context, and test their understanding through interactive quizzes.

💡 Why This Matters

Indigenous art is more than visual expression. It encodes history, identity, land relationships, and community memory. In a digital age filled with endless images, understanding is not automatic.

This platform ensures that Indigenous artworks are not only seen, but understood.

By combining preservation with interactivity, we aim to create a sustainable, evolving archive that bridges culture and technology for future generations.
